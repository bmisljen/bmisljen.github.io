This is a website I use for my web and app development business. It was created using the free BootStrap Agency template: https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/
along with several additions and modifications such as a video header and a non-php contact form. The website is built using: HTML/CSS, BootStrap, Font Awesome icons, JavaScript and JQuery. It does not have any back end 
as Github pages does not support non-static content. The contact form is powered using Formspree: https://formspree.io/. 

To check out the website please visit: https://www.boriswebappdevelopment.ca/

To make it work for yourself, simply fork the repo and upload it to a GitHub pages repo (one per Github account) and update the CNAME file to point to your domain name 
(or just use the default <repo.github.io>) domain name (no CNAME file needed in this case). The only HTML file to edit is index.html, the only CSS file to edit is: agency.css and the only 
JS file to edit is: agency.js ... Pretty simple. 

If you need help creating your site please email me at: boris@boriswebappdevelopment.ca and I can give you a hand. 

Have fun!
